## Update (4. July 2022 | 12:03 AM)
We have released an update to change the in-game names.

# Accounts temporarily disabled
Due to some improvements we disabled the feature to login, register and view your account settings. I'm working really hard to bring them back but th Account feature is still not safe and stable enough. And since we don't have any online games, that shouldn't really be a problem.

### FAQ:

##### I want to change my InGame Name for Devnite. What can i do?
A: With the Update V0.1.3 we added a change Name feature in the Game settings. Please use this to change your Name!

##### What about the "Login with DevNite" feature on other Websites?
A: Since we only use it on one website, this shouldn't be a problem.

##### Is my account still there?
A: Yes of course! We will not remove accounts.
